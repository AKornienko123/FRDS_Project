FRDS_Project


Minor updates were made to the final version of the code and report after the presentation. These changes are described in the final report. We added one more key feature, introduced an additional rule, and made a few small adjustments. 
While these modifications did not significantly affect the F1-score, they were intended to improve the robustness of our FRDS.
